"""Comprehensive exploration of Edain factions.

An Edain faction is a `PlayerTemplate` with `PlayableSide = Yes`. From it hang a spellbook, the
starting plot flags that unpack a base (citadel + foundations) or a single structure, the buildings
constructed on those foundations, and the units / heroes / upgrades those buildings produce.
`sage_edain` walks the loaded `Game` (and the mod's binary base layouts, via sagemap) into one
explicit ownership graph — the link between a faction and everything a player of it can see.

It is an orchestration layer: resolution lives in `sage_ini.model.state` and `sage_utils.views`;
this package only assembles those primitives into the `FactionGraph` shape.
