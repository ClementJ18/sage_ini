"""Resolving a base layout (`.bse`) into the structures it places.

A faction's castle/camp/outpost does not name its buildings in the ini — the start flag's
`CastleBehavior` names a *base layout* (`CastleToUnpackForFaction = Men gondor_castle …`), and the
layout itself is a binary WorldBuilder file under the mod's `bases/` folder (`gondor_castle.bse`).
The placed objects in that file — the citadel keep, the build foundations, the prebuilt walls and
gates — are the structures a player actually sees once the base unpacks.

So this module bridges `sagemap` (which parses the `.bse`) and the loaded `Game` (which knows each
placed template's KindOf): it finds the layout file, reads the distinct placed templates, and
classifies them into citadel / foundation / prebuilt by KindOf. `sagemap` is an optional dependency
(the `[map]` extra); without it base decomposition degrades to empty rather than failing.
