"""A non-technical stat/weapon/ability snapshot of an object — the same facts sage_ui's UnitPanel
shows (health, armor-derived durability, weapons, speed, vision, cost, abilities), but as plain
serialisable data for the web UI.

Resolved at base state: no upgrades toggled, lowest experience rank. A horde's combat stats come
from its contained unit while its cost comes from the horde (mirroring `UnitPanel._init_sources`).
Every read is guarded — lazy field conversion can raise, and a missing stat just stays None.
