"""Generic, lossless parser for SAGE-engine (BFME) ini files.

See PLAN.md for the roadmap and CONVENTIONS.md for the coding rules; `docs/cookbook.md`
for task-oriented recipes against the public API.

## Public API & stability

The names re-exported here (and listed in `__all__`) are the supported surface: the
loader, the typed `Game`/`IniObject` model, the comment-preserving parser and printer, the
`walk`/`Xref` traversal helpers, and the `Diagnostic` types a tool author builds checkers
against. Each public module also declares its own `__all__`; anything not exported — and
every `_`-prefixed name — is internal and may change without notice.

`sage_ini` ships a `py.typed` marker, so the field typing on the model surfaces in a
consumer's type checker and IDE. The package follows semantic versioning **on that public
surface**: within a major version, the exported names and their documented behaviour stay
backward-compatible (the game-schema model classes grow new fields, which is additive). The
library is pre-1.0, so the surface may still shift between minor versions until it settles;
`__version__` tracks that.
