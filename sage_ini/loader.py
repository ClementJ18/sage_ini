"""Whole-game assembly: build one `Game` from a folder of ini files, so cross-file
references resolve. Root files (those nothing `#include`s) are parsed with their includes
expanded, in mod-over-base overlay order; a file that fails to construct becomes a
`load-error` diagnostic rather than aborting the run.

Map files (`maps/.../map.ini`) are excluded — each is a per-map context (`load_map`).
