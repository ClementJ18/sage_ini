"""Fuzzy "did you mean" suggestions. When a token fails to resolve against a closed set
of known names — a dangling cross-reference, an unknown attribute, a missing macro or
string — the likeliest intended name is often a near-spelling already in that set. These
helpers surface that guess in a diagnostic message.

Suggestions only: the match is probabilistic, so it is never used to drive an automated
rewrite (unlike the case fixes in `sage_lint.fixer`); it informs a human, who decides.

Computing a suggestion runs difflib over the *whole* candidate set, and on a large game the
objects table alone holds ~11k names — matching every unresolved token against it is the
dominant cost of a full `validate`/lint. So suggestions are **off by default** and produce no
hint; a caller that wants them (the `lint --suggest` flag, an interactive tool) turns them on
for the duration with `suggestions_enabled()`.
