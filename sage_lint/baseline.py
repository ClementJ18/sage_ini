"""A baseline of accepted diagnostics, so a noisy existing project can adopt the linter
without first fixing everything: record today's problems once, then report only what is
*new* against that record. The pre-existing set is suppressed (and the run exits clean),
which lets the linter go into CI immediately while the backlog is burned down over time.

Matching is deliberately **line-insensitive**. A baseline entry is keyed by `(file, code,
message)` with an occurrence count — never a line number — so editing a file (which shifts
every line below) does not resurface unrelated baselined diagnostics. The count is still
honoured: if a file held two of some problem and now holds three, the third is reported as
new. File paths are stored relative to the lint root with forward slashes, so the baseline
is portable across machines and checkouts.

The file is JSON (machine-written, human-diffable): a sorted list of entries, each
`{file, code, message, count}`. Generate or refresh it with `lint --write-baseline`.
