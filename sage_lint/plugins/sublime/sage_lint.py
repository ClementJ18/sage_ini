"""Sublime Text 4 plugin: lint and format SAGE ini files with sage_lint, inline.

Each project folder gets a long-lived `sage_lint serve` daemon: it assembles the whole game
once, reports it, then re-lints individual files against that cache on save (or, with
`lint_on_idle`, while typing) in milliseconds — so cross-file references resolve without
re-parsing the folder every keystroke. Diagnostics are line-level (sage_lint spans carry no
column), so each is drawn as a squiggly underline under the offending line, a gutter icon,
and the message on its own phantom line below the code (`diagnostic_display` switches this
to a right-aligned annotation, or off); the full message also shows in the status bar when
the caret is on the line, and on hover with the code's description.

The cache refreshes on the initial build, on **Lint Folder** (a daemon rebuild), and — with
`auto_rebuild` — automatically (debounced) when a save adds or removes definitions, so a
brand new definition resolves from sibling files and references to a deleted one re-flag
without a manual rebuild. While a build is in flight, per-file lints are deferred and re-run
against the fresh cache when it lands (never reported from stale state), and a lint result
that arrives after further edits is dropped rather than drawn on the wrong lines.

The same daemon also serves a **symbol index** from the assembled game (an `index` request
after every build): every definition with its source span, the macro and string tables, and
each module's typed field schema. That index — the real parse, not a separate regex pass —
backs Go to Definition, Browse Symbols, the per-file defined/referenced symbol lists, the
module-documentation popups, hover previews and name/module/field completions.

Commands (Command Palette, "SAGE Lint: ...", and the right-click "Sage Lint" submenu): Lint
Folder, Format File, Fix File / Fix Folder (auto-fixable diagnostics), Show Diagnostics, Next
/ Previous Diagnostic, Copy Message, Go to Definition, Browse Symbols, Show Module
Documentation, Symbols in File, Referenced Symbols, Edit Macro Values.

Install with the bundled `install.sh`, or copy this folder into Sublime's `Packages`
directory. Configure the interpreter and the checkout path in `SageLint.sublime-settings`
— see the README.
