"""Rules over on-disk asset files: that a referenced texture/model/map exists, and that a
WorldBuilder layout file is named the way the engine loads it.

Every field that holds an asset path is typed with an `_AssetFile` subclass carrying the
extension(s) the engine expects (`_TextureFile` -> `.tga`/`.dds`, `_ModelFile` -> `.w3d`,
`_MapFile` -> `.map`/`.bse`). The loader crawls the mod root alongside the ini files and records
the loose texture/model filenames in `game.assets` and the `.map`/`.bse` layout files in
`game.map_files` (see `sage_ini.parser.io`). The three missing-file rules (`MissingTextureFileRule`,
`MissingModelFileRule`, `MissingMapFileRule`) walk the typed fields and confirm each referenced
name resolves to one of those files — one code per kind, so a texture, model and map miss can be
selected, ignored and counted apart; `MapFolderNameRule` checks the `<name>/<name>.ext` convention
the reference resolution relies on.

The engine searches its asset roots by basename and treats a kind's extensions as
interchangeable (a `.tga` reference resolves to a `.dds` of the same name and vice versa), so
the membership check mirrors that — strip any directory and surrounding quotes, reduce the name
to its stem, and accept the file under any of the kind's expected extensions. Engine sentinels
(`NONE`, `<ANY>`, …) are left alone. When a kind was not crawled at all (a single file linted in
isolation, or assets shipped in archives), its index is empty and the rule stays silent rather
than flagging every reference.
