"""The lint rule framework: a `Rule` produces `Diagnostic`s over a loaded `Game`. Each
subclass with a `code` auto-registers; `run_rules` isolates a faulty rule so it cannot
abort the rest of the run.

A rule may opt out of the default run by setting `default = False`: it then runs only when the
caller asks for it (the CLI's `--assets`/`--select`). The missing-file rules use this — without
the base-game archives loaded they would report every base asset as missing, so they are opt-in
rather than flooding a plain `lint`."""
