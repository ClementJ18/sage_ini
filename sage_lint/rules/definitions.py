    Scope is deliberately narrow to stay useful rather than noisy. Engine entry-point kinds (a
    faction, the game data, a terrain, the living-world singletons) are loaded by the engine
    directly and named by nothing in the data, so they are excluded wholesale: the rule only
    considers kinds some typed field can actually reference (`referenceable_keys`). Objects get
    their own off-by-default rule (`unused-object`), and the asset/audio tables are left to the
    asset checks (see `_UNUSED_DEFINITION_EXCLUDES`).

    On a folder lint, a definition only a map.ini reaches is not reported: each map is built
    as its own context after the global pass, and `build_cache` retracts any unused finding a
    map build turns out to reference (a campaign map's command set naming a global button).
