"""Rule: a child block whose type the schema does not recognize.

A `Behavior`/`Draw`/`Body`/... module names its class in its header (`Behavior =
PhysicsBehavior Tag`); a named sub-block is typed by its own name. When that type is not in
the model `REGISTRY` the builder cannot type it, so it is parked raw in the parent's
`_extras` and would otherwise vanish silently — hiding both genuine typos (`PhysicsBeavior`
for `PhysicsBehavior`) and still-unmodeled block kinds. This rule surfaces every one of them
for manual triage.
