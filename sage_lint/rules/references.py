"""Rule: a cross-reference field naming a definition the game never declares.

A `Reference` converter resolves a name to its registered object when present and otherwise
passes the raw name through unchanged (`types.Reference` defers the strict check here on
purpose). So after conversion a *resolved* reference is an `IniObject` and a *dangling* one
is the leftover `str` — the signal this rule keys on. References are found wherever they are
typed: a scalar field, a `List[...]` of them, or a key inside a `KeyedRecord` line (e.g.
`DetachableRiderUpdate.DeathEntry`'s `RiderOCL`).

A kind that the corpus does not model as a block (animations, predefined eva events) leaves
its table empty, so every such name is a bare string by design; the empty-table guard skips
those wholesale rather than flagging all of them.
