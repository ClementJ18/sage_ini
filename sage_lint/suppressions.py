"""Inline suppression comments: a comment on a line silences named diagnostic codes
reported on that line.

After any SAGE comment marker (`;`, `//`, `--`):

    BuildCost = 90000              ; sagelint: ignore[out-of-range]
    Weapon RetiredBlade            ; sagelint: ignore[unused-definition, dangling-reference]
    ArmorSet = Prototype           ; sagelint: ignore

Codes are the bracketed list, comma- or space-separated, matched case-insensitively
against `Diagnostic.code`; the bare form (no brackets, or empty brackets) silences every
code on the line. A diagnostic is matched by the line its span *starts* on, so a
block-level finding like `unused-definition` is suppressed by a comment on the block's
header line.

Filtering runs inside the lint entry points (`sage_lint.linter`), re-reading each
diagnosed file once per run. Reading from disk rather than the parsed AST keeps the
mechanism uniform across every diagnostic source — parse errors on lines the block parser
never typed, conversion facts, and rule findings — and the editor daemon lints a live
buffer via a temp file written beside the real one, so unsaved suppression comments are
seen too.
