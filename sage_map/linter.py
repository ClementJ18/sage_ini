"""Phase 3: flag dangling references in a `.map`, resolved against the assembled game.

Every script argument that names something — an object template, a science, a map-local team, a
localization label — is resolved the way the engine would: GAME-scope names against the built
`Game` (via `Game.lookup`, case-insensitive), MAP-scope names against the map's own symbols, and
STRINGS against `Game.strings`. A name that resolves to nothing is reported: the engine silently
no-ops the action, so the script does not do what its author meant.

Two guards keep the check honest, mirroring sage_lint's missing-asset rule:

* engine sentinels (`<All Players>`, `<This Object>`, `NONE`, empty) are left alone; and
* a GAME table (or the strings table) that was never populated — a map linted without building its
  mod — is skipped rather than flagged wholesale, since the miss would be the build's fault.

A `.map` is binary, so a diagnostic's `Span` points at the file with the offending argument's
logical address (`<ScriptName>/if_true[2]/arg[1]`) carried in the message and `extra`.
