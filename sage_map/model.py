"""Phase 2: a game-aware view over a parsed `.map`.

Harvests the symbols a map declares for itself — teams, players, waypoints and their paths,
trigger areas, scripts, named units — keyed by the same `target` names the MAP-scope entries in
`ARG_SPECS` use. The Phase 3 rules ask `MapSymbols.resolve(target, name)` to tell a dangling
map-local reference (a script targeting a team the map never defines) from a valid one.

Counters, flags and boundaries are referenced by scripts but never *declared* — the engine creates
them on first use — so they are deliberately untracked: a reference to one cannot be dangling, and
`resolve` returns `None` (skip) for those targets rather than a membership answer.

`iter_script_arguments` walks the script tree and pairs every argument with its `ResolvedArg`
(`sage_map.scripts`) and a logical address — `<ScriptName>/if_true[2]/arg[1]` — that names where in
the binary it lives, since a `.map` has no text line for a Diagnostic to point at.
