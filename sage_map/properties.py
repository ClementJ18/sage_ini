"""What an object *instance property* references, by property key — the object-side companion to
`scripts.ARG_SPECS`.

A placed object carries a dict of properties; most are scalars (health, enabled, scale), but a few
name another entity: the team that owns it, an upgrade it starts with. This registry types those so
the linter can flag a property pointing at something the map or game never defines.

Typed incrementally, the sage_ini schema-coverage way: a property whose target is uncertain is left
out rather than guessed at (a wrong scope is a false positive, an absent one merely a gap). Scopes
mirror `scripts.Scope`; only GAME and MAP entries are resolved.
