"""Hand-labeled object-filter -> archetype registry, plus a discovery tool to grow it.

A weapon's `DamageScalar` lines scope a multiplier to an object filter (`250% ANY +HERO`).
To summarise a weapon for an infobox we name the recognisable filter shapes: `+HERO +MACHINE
+MONSTER` is a "Single" target (a unit not in a horde), `+STRUCTURE` is a "Structure".
`ARCHETYPES` maps a filter's shape to that label; the renderer interprets the multiplier
context (0% excludes, >100% is a bonus) on top of the label.

The key is the `(included, excluded)` pair of object/kindof name sets, so `+INFANTRY -CAVALRY
-HERO` ("infantry, but not cavalry/hero") stays distinct from `+CAVALRY +HERO +INFANTRY`. The
descriptor (ANY/ALL/NONE) and relations (ENEMIES/ALLIES) are dropped — they scope targeting,
not the object category. A `0%`-on-exclusion filter (`ALL -STRUCTURE` = only structures are
hit) is the renderer's job to read as its complement, not a label mapping.

`ARCHETYPES` is grown by hand. Run this module over a corpus to list the distinct filter
shapes by frequency, then label the common ones:

    .venv/Scripts/python -m sage_wiki.archetypes <source-folder>...

Unlabeled shapes fall back to a readable auto-string so nothing breaks while labeling.
