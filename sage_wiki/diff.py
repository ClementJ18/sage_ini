"""Diffing a page's infobox against the values computed from a game object.

The diff is infobox-driven: it pairs each parameter the infobox already has (and that
this tool can compute) with the object's value; parameters the infobox lacks are left
out. Different templates name the same stat differently (bare `damage` vs `damage_melee`,
`object_name` vs `object`), so `FIELD_ALIASES` maps a logical field to the params that
may carry it, preferred first, and the diff uses whichever the page actually has.
