Crops the object's portrait `MappedImage` (its `SelectPortrait`, else `ButtonImage`; a
horde's comes from its contained unit) to a PNG and works out how the page's `image`
parameter should point at the uploaded file —
the headless, Qt-/network-free half of the upload tool (the upload itself is the wiki
client's job). Files are named after the object's internal id, stable across display-name
