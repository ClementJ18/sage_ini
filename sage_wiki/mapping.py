"""Computing infobox parameter values from a parsed game object.

`FIELD_MAP` ties each infobox parameter to a function over a `FieldContext`. Stats are
resolved at the object's base state (no upgrades, lowest rank) through the same typed
layer the browser uses. As the browser does, a horde's combat stats come from its
contained unit while cost/movement stay the horde's; a build shell with no Body of its
own is read from its first build variation.

A leveled building's stats are emitted per level as indexed columns (`health1`, …), each
read under that level's cumulative economy upgrades. Only fields sage_ini computes cleanly
are mapped; the infobox's manual fields are never written.
