"""Generating a whole Edain wiki page draft from a parsed game object: infobox, quote,
recruitment tables (buildings), abilities, upgrades, an empty strategy box and navbox/category
templates. What is not derivable (ability prose nuance, manual infobox fields) is left as an
empty placeholder.

Stats come from `mapping.computed_fields`; abilities and upgrades from the object's
active `CommandSet`, keeping only the buttons the player sees (palantir/radial) that are
abilities or upgrades. Upgrades are only hinted, since the wiki transcludes them through
hand-curated labels with no algorithmic tie to the ini names.

A building also gets a recruitment section: its UNIT_BUILD buttons become a unit table, and
its REVIVE buttons a hero table — the revive buttons indexed in slot order against the
faction's buildable heroes, with the building recruiting the heroes whose button lacks the
`NEED_UPGRADE` option. Preview-only; nothing is saved.
