"""Condense a multi-nugget weapon into the compact damage lines an infobox shows.

A weapon spreads its damage across several `DamageNugget`s, each scoped to object filters
(`DamageScalar`), plus a `MetaImpactNugget` for knockback. `weapon_summary_lines` turns that
into a damage header per nugget, each followed by its modifiers as wiki bullet items, e.g.::

    '''vs General''': 150 WATER (50R)
    * +150% vs Single
    * Knockback (50R) vs Non-hero
    '''vs Structure''': 240 SIEGE (30R)

Each header names the nugget's primary target archetype (see `sage_wiki.archetypes`, bolded
for the wiki), its modified damage, damage type and blast radius; per-archetype bonuses,
knockback (MetaImpactNugget) and damage-over-time (DOTNugget, e.g. `POISON DoT 20/s for 30s`)
hang below it as `*` bullets. A `0%` scalar drops an archetype: on an inclusion
(`0% +STRUCTURE`) it just removes that archetype from the general target (another nugget covers
it); on an exclusion (`0% ALL -STRUCTURE`) only the spared set is hit, so the header's target
becomes that complement. Weapon-wide effects (knockback, DoT) attach to the broadest header.
