"""Corpus noise check: a lint rule must not flood the base game (PLAN Step 3.2).

The base game is mostly valid, so a judgment rule that fires on a large fraction
of it is wrong — its premise is too broad — not a discovery of thousands of bugs.
This gate assembles the `data/` base game, runs every registered rule, and holds
each rule's hit count under a plausibility ceiling, so a future rule that floods
fails here instead of drowning real findings in a report.

The exhaustive coverage signals are exempt: `unrecognized-block` (every unmodeled
sub-block) and `unknown-attribute` (every still-untyped field, ~58k of them), both
raised at ERROR to drive the schema toward 100% coverage. They are meant to fire
broadly until the schema catches up, so the ceiling applies only to the remaining
judgment rules — the ones whose firing signals an actual mistake.

Measured on the base game (25,375 objects), for the record:
    duplicate-definition       11      out-of-range                0
    undefined-macro             0      respawn-entry-order         0
    respawn-unknown-level      44      unknown-string-label      307
    repeated-field            247      unknown-attribute        58095
